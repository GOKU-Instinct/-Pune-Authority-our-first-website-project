<p>Pune , formerly spelled Poona (1857â€“1978),[19][20][21] is the second largest city in the Indian state of Maharashtra, after Mumbai. It is the ninth most populous city in the country with an estimated population of 3.13 million.[22] Along with its industrial twin Pimpri-Chinchwad as well as the three cantonment towns of Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road, Pune forms the urban core of the eponymous Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).[23][24] According to the 2011 census, the urban area has a combined population of 5.05 million while the population of the metropolitan region is estimated at 7.27 million.[24][10] Situated 560 metres (1,837 feet) above sea level on the Deccan plateau on the right bank of the Mutha river,[25] Pune is also the administrative headquarters of its namesake district. In the 18th century, the city was the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire and so was one of the most important political centres on the Indian subcontinent.<br>

Considered to be the cultural capital of Maharashtra (India),[27][28] Pune is known as the "Oxford of the East" due to the presence of several well-known educational institutions.[29][30] The city has emerged as a major educational hub in recent decades, with nearly half of the total international students in the country studying in Pune.[31][32] Research institutes of information technology, education, management and training attract students and professionals from India and overseas. Several colleges in Pune have student-exchange programs with colleges in Europe.<br><br>

Since the 1950s Pune has had a traditional economic base as most of the old industries continue to grow. The city is known for its manufacturing and automobile industries.<br><br>

According to a 16 May 2018 article in Hindustan Times [34]),Pune has four times more polluted air than the standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).<br>
